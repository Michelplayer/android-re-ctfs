# Android Reverse Engineering CTFs

Welcome to the Android Reverse Engineering CTF repository by **Cynychwr (Daniel Oliveira)**!

This repository contains a collection of Android-focused Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges designed to teach and test various reverse engineering skills including static analysis, dynamic analysis, cryptography, obfuscation techniques, and mobile security concepts.

## üéØ About

These CTFs are created to provide hands-on experience with:
- **Static Analysis**: APK decompilation, code analysis, resource inspection
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime behavior, debugging, instrumentation
- **Cryptography**: Various encoding/encryption techniques
- **Anti-Analysis**: Obfuscation, packing, detection evasion
- **Mobile Security**: Android-specific vulnerabilities and techniques

## üö© Available CTFs

| CTF Name | Difficulty | Flags | Description | Status |
|----------|------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [OneList](./onelist/) | Beginner ‚Üí Expert | 10 | Android todo app with progressive difficulty flags | ‚úÖ Available |

## üìù Submission Guidelines

Found all the flags? Want to share your writeup? Here's how to get recognized:

### How to Submit Solutions

1. **Complete the CTF** - Find all (or partial) flags from any available CTF
2. **Create a Writeup** - Document your solution process. This can be:
   - A blog post on your personal website
   - A GitHub repository with detailed analysis
   - A Medium article or similar platform
   - Any public documentation of your approach

3. **Submit via LinkedIn** - Send me a message on LinkedIn with:
   - Your GitHub username
   - Link to your writeup
   - Which CTF you completed and how many flags you found
   - **LinkedIn**: [in/danielsadoliveira/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsadoliveira/)

### What Makes a Good Writeup?

- **Clear methodology** - Explain your analysis approach
- **Tools used** - Mention the tools and techniques employed
- **Screenshots/evidence** - Show your work with relevant images
- **Step-by-step process** - Help others learn from your approach
- **Challenges faced** - Discuss difficulties and how you overcame them

## üèÜ Recognition

Successful submissions will be added to each CTF's **WALL.md** (Wall of Fame) with:
- Your name linked to your GitHub profile
- Link to your writeup
- Completion status (Full/Partial)
- Submission date

## üõ† Getting Started

Each CTF directory contains:
- **README.md** - CTF description, setup instructions, and hints
- **WALL.md** - Wall of fame for successful submissions
- **Release files** - APK and any required resources

## üìã General Tips

- **Use multiple tools** - Different tools reveal different information
- **Static + Dynamic** - Combine both analysis approaches
- **Take notes** - Document your findings as you go
- **Read the code** - Understanding the implementation is key
- **Be patient** - Some flags require multiple steps or conditions

## üîß Recommended Tools

### Static Analysis
