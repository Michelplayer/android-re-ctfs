# OneList CTF

**A progressive Android reverse engineering challenge with 10 flags**

## üì± Overview

OneList is an Android todo list application that serves as a comprehensive CTF challenge covering various reverse engineering techniques. The challenge features 10 flags with progressive difficulty, starting from beginner-level static analysis and advancing to expert-level dynamic analysis, cryptography, and anti-analysis techniques.

**Difficulty**: Beginner ‚Üí Expert
**Total Flags**: 10
**Flag Format**: `CYWR{...}`
**Estimated Time**: 2-8 hours (depending on experience)

## üéØ Challenge Categories

### Static Analysis (Flags 1-5)
- **Flag 1**: Basic string discovery
- **Flag 2**: Encoded configuration data
- **Flag 3**: Metadata analysis
- **Flag 4**: Algorithm identification and reversal
- **Flag 5**: Multi-layer obfuscation

### Dynamic Analysis (Flags 6-10)
- **Flag 6**: Runtime behavior analysis
- **Flag 7**: Database interaction patterns
- **Flag 8**: Advanced cryptography and hidden assets
- **Flag 9**: Code loading mechanisms and obfuscation
- **Flag 10**: Native code analysis with steganography
